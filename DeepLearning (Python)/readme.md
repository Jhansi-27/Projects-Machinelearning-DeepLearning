<h3>Description of the project:</h3>
* We are given a lander game which will randomly generate a landing zone and unsafe terrain.
* We are required to safely land the ship without touching the unsafe terrain. Following the completion of this task, data will be generated automatically.
* Using this data we need to train your own neural network with the ability to complete the same task.
* The neural network created should suffice the following conditions:
  * Design and implement a Feed-Forward Backpropagation neural network
  * where:
  i. Inputs:  X position to target, Y position to target
  ii. Outputs: NewVecocity X, NewVelocity Y
  * Train your neural network in your Python implementation (offline training
~100 epochs) with the data you have collected during your attempt at the lander game.
  * Test your neural network by running the most recent weights (just feedforward) to see how the lander performs and compute the Root Mean
Squared Error.
