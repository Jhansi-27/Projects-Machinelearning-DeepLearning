<h3>Description of the project:</h3>
- We are given a lander game which will randomly generate a landing zone and unsafe terrain.
- We are required to safely land the ship without touching the unsafe terrain. Following the completion of this task, data will be generated automatically.
- Using this data we need to train your own neural network with the ability to complete the same task.
- The neural network created should suffice the following conditions:
i. Design and implement a Feed-Forward Backpropagation neural network
- Inputs:  X position to target, Y position to target
- NewVecocity X, NewVelocity Y
ii. Train your neural network in your Python implementation (offline training
~100 epochs) with the data you have collected during your attempt at the lander game.
iii. Test your neural network by running the most recent weights (just feedforward) to see how the lander performs and compute the Root Mean
Squared Error.
