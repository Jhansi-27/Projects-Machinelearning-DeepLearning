<h2><center>Travel Insurance Assignment</center></h2>

- Travel insurance is one business sector where there is an abundance of data, using machine 
learning techniques companies wants to take effective decisions by utilizing the data in their 
hands in order to improve their market strategy, attract customers with discounted deals and 
increase their profits by spending their funds wisely.

- This repository contains two Python files, that were aimed to solve two main prediction tasks that are usually encountered by travel insurance companies.
#### The first task is to classify or segment the customers of a travel insurance company in to two groups, based on whether they file a claim or not after thier trip.
  <ul>
  <li>The crucial question here is to find    who are their target customers, the answer is to analyse their previous customers data and target those customers who are less likely to make a claim after their travel.</li>
  <li>By doing this, company can retain these customers on longrun by offering them discounted premium. This enhances the customer's interest in the company and reduces the customer churn. Also, company can benefit from only offering discounts to their target customers and not wasting thier money on non-potential customers. </li>
  <li>Analysing previous customers data and identifying trends helps company to comeup with new strategies to attract new customers and retain thier old customers.</li> 
</ul>

 #### The second task many companies are presented with is, to acess how much money the customer is likely to cliam after his/her travel?
  <ul>
  <li>Based on previous travel history of the customer with the company, we need to predict if a customer files a claim how much the amount going to be!</li>
  <li>This helps companies to identify the customers, who are filing high claim and potential reasons for the claim filed on these ocassions.</li>
  </ul>
