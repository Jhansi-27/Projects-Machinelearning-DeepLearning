And a Ponemon Institute survey revealed that healthcare fields store <a href=\"https://www.buildingbetterhealthcare.co.uk/technical/article_page/Comment_Health_networks__delivering_the_future_of_healthcare/94931\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">30 percent of global data</a>.</p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With primary sources, electronic medical records (EMRs), clinical trials, genetic information, billing, wearable data, care management databases, scientific articles, social media, and internet research, the healthcare industry has no shortage of data available. Since </span><a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/539qzk/looking-up-symptoms-online-these-companies-are-collecting-your-data\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">72 percent of people look up health information online</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and more patients use tools like Zocdoc to communicate with medical professionals and book appointments, it’s easier than ever before to manage customer data in one centralized location. </span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Quantified health” is a relatively new movement that integrates data directly from consumer wearables (pedometers, Fitbits, Muse headbands, etc.), blood pressure cuffs, glucometers, and scales into EMRs through smartphones (Apple’s HealthKit, Google Fit, and Samsung Health are a few examples), and can pick up on warning signs faster by tracking changes in behavior and vital signs.</span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a LinkedIn’s </span><a href=\"https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/research/LinkedIns-2017-US-Emerging-Jobs-Report\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">U.S. Emerging Jobs report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the data science field has grown by 350 percent since 2012 and only 35,000 candidates have the necessary skills to fill job openings.

       "<h2>Drug Discovery</h2>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It costs up to $2.6 billion and takes 12 years to bring a drug to market. Big data allows scientists to simulate the reaction of a drug with body proteins and different types of cells and conditions, so that it has a much higher likelihood of gaining Food and Drug Administration approval and curing diverse patients (e.g., people with certain mutation profiles).</span></p>\n",
       "<p><a href=\"https://www.rdmag.com/article/2017/12/disrupting-drug-discovery-how-gsk-using-data-more-effectively-r-d-drive-innovation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Ramsey,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> chief data officer at GSK, shared how large pharmaceutical companies are using clinical trial data and partnerships with biobanks to expedite the drug discovery process. Ramsey said, “We’re really pushing to see how far we can advance use of AI and computer simulation in the drug discovery process with the goal being to take the process to maybe less than two years.”</span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He went on: “That’s one of the benefits of GSK being a large pharmaceutical company because we have hundreds and hundreds and thousands of clinical trials… If you look at the clinical trial data one of the things that’s extremely important is to make sure the diversity of our clinical trials match the population diversity. We can better understand how to design the trial to be effective and efficient and also match the diversity.” </span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Startups are also raising significant amounts of venture capital to expedite the drug discovery and testing process. </span><a href=\"https://benevolent.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BenevolentAI</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a unicorn based in London that has raised $115 million to start over 20 drug programs and create “</span><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/benevolentai-raises-115-million-to-extend-its-leading-global-position-in-the-field-of-ai-enabled-drug-development-680180573.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a bioscience machine brain</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, purpose-built to discover new medicines and cures for disease.” Its first clinical trial this year in Europe and the U.S. will address excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson’s disease. </span></p>\n",
       "<h2>Disease Prevention</h2>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to transform healthcare is to recognize risks and recommend prevention plans before health risks become a major issue. Through wearables and other tracking devices that take into account historical patterns and genetic information, it’s possible to recognize a problem before it gets out of hand.</span></p>\n",

       "<h2>Diagnosis</h2>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> estimates that around <a href=\"http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/reports/2015/improving-diagnosis-in-healthcare\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">12 million Americans receive misdiagnoses</a>, which can sometimes have life-threatening repercussions. A </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BBC article</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> notes that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180523-how-gender-bias-affects-your-healthcare\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">diagnostic errors</a> cause an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 deaths annually. </span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most effective uses of data science in healthcare is medical imaging. </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/activewizards-machine-learning-company/top-7-data-science-use-cases-in-healthcare-cddfa82fd9e3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Computers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can learn to interpret MRIs, X-rays, mammographies, and other types of images, identify patterns in the data, and detect tumors, artery stenosis, organ anomalies, and more. </span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stanford University researchers have also developed data-driven models to </span><a href=\"https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/ecg/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">diagnose irregular heart rhythms</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from ECGs more quickly than a cardiologist and distinguish between images showing </span><a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/people/esteva/nature/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benign skin marks and malignant lesions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n",
       "<p><a href=\"https://iquity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MedTech-Insight-Article.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Iquity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a large-scale predictive analytics healthcare platform, conducted a pilot study by analyzing four million data points from 20 million New York residents. Testing with a combination of misdiagnosed and correctly diagnosed patients of multiple sclerosis, Iquity predicted with 90 percent accuracy the onset of the disease eight months before it could be detected with traditional tools, like magnetic resonance imaging and spinal tapping. </span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even online searches can help with diagnostic accuracy. </span><a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3159.full\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft researchers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> analyzed 6.4 million users of Bing whose search results suggested that they had pancreatic cancer. Looking back at previous queries for keywords, such as blood clots and weight loss, researchers found that they could use search engine topics to predict a future pancreatic cancer diagnosis. </span></p>\n",
       "<h2>Treatment</h2>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With more data on individual patient characteristics, it is now possible to deliver more precise prescriptions and personalized care. With initiatives like the National Institutes of Health’s <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/27528684/1000-genomes-project/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">1000 Genome Project</a>, an open-source study of regions of the genome associated with common diseases like coronary heart disease and diabetes, scientists are learning more about the complexity of human genes, and learning that, often, one size does not fix all when it comes to medication and treatments. Data science is also helping with the emerging field of gene therapy, which involves inserting genetic material into cells instead of traditional drugs to compensate for abnormal genes.  </span></p>\n",
       "<p><a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/nextbio-teams-emory-university-and-aflac-cancer-center-to-improve-outcomes-for-children\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emory University and the Aflac Cancer Treatment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are partnering with NextBio to study medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumor typically affecting children. Although radiation therapy was previously the only form of treatment for this type of cancer, NextBio can examine clinical and genomic data to find a patient’s specific biomarkers and customize treatment. </span><a href=\"https://www.rdmag.com/news/2018/07/discovery-new-biomarker-could-provide-personalized-treatment-options-bladder-cancer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mount Sinai</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> researchers also used biomarker models and cancer genomic data to segment types of bladder cancers that were resistant to chemotherapy and thus would need other treatment methods.</span></p>\n",
       "<h2>Post-Care Monitoring</h2>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After any type of surgery or treatment, there is the risk of complications and recurring pain, which can be difficult to manage once the patient leaves the hospital. Remote in-home monitoring helps doctors stay in touch with patients in real time while freeing limited and costly hospital resources.</span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intel’s </span><a href=\"https://www.healthcareitnews.com/sponsored-content/predictive-analytics-used-help-large-hospital-group-reduce-readmission-rates\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloudera software</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">helps hospitals predict the chances that a patient will be readmitted in the next 30 days, based on EMR data and socioeconomic status of the hospital’s location. </span></p>\n",

Patients checked in daily on their apps to input data on pain levels, allowing the care team to track progress over time and receive intelligent alerts on potential problems. </span></p>\n",
       "<h2>Hospital Operations</h2>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hospitals are cost-sensitive and face complex operational problems, such as how many staff to assign at certain hours to maximize efficiency, how to ensure enough hospital beds are available to meet patient demand, and how to enhance utilization in the operating room. Predictive analytics can optimize scheduling and even go so far as to tell hospital staff which beds should be cleaned first and which patients may face challenges during the discharge process.</span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analytics software can streamline emergency room operations, ensuring that each admitted patient goes through the most efficient order of operations. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emory University Hospital</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">used data science to predict the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/10/why-hospitals-need-better-data-science\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">demand for different types of lab tests</a>, cutting wait time by 75 percent. </span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, </span><a href=\"https://www.sisense.com/blog/3-ways-bi-can-improve-efficiency-in-healthcare/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business intelligence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can streamline billing, identify patients who are at risk of late payments or financial difficulties, and coordinate with financial, collections, and insurance departments.

       "<h2>What’s Next for Data Science in Healthcare</h2>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is the right time for a data-driven healthcare industry and many players are participating in this change, including large biotech and pharmaceutical companies, payers and providers, hospitals, university research centers, and venture-backed startups. Data science can save lives by predicting the probability that patients will suffer from certain diseases, providing AI-powered medical advice in rural and remote areas in underserved communities, customizing therapies for different patient profiles, and finding cures to cancer, AIDS, Ebola, and other terminal diseases. </span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As in any industry, there are concerns about the use of data science in healthcare. From a logistical standpoint, data often lives in disparate states, hospitals, and administrative units and it is challenging to integrate it into one cohesive system. Many patients are additionally concerned about the protection and privacy of their healthcare information, especially as </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">companies like Google face lawsuits for <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/google-broke-canadas-privacy-laws-with-targeted-ads-regulator-says/article16343346/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">using sensitive health information in ad targeting</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

       "<h2>Drug Discovery</h2>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It costs up to $2.6 billion and takes 12 years to bring a drug to market. Big data allows scientists to simulate the reaction of a drug with body proteins and different types of cells and conditions, so that it has a much higher likelihood of gaining Food and Drug Administration approval and curing diverse patients (e.g., people with certain mutation profiles).</span></p>\n",
       "<p><a href=\"https://www.rdmag.com/article/2017/12/disrupting-drug-discovery-how-gsk-using-data-more-effectively-r-d-drive-innovation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Ramsey,</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> chief data officer at GSK, shared how large pharmaceutical companies are using clinical trial data and partnerships with biobanks to expedite the drug discovery process. Ramsey said, “We’re really pushing to see how far we can advance use of AI and computer simulation in the drug discovery process with the goal being to take the process to maybe less than two years.”</span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He went on: “That’s one of the benefits of GSK being a large pharmaceutical company because we have hundreds and hundreds and thousands of clinical trials… If you look at the clinical trial data one of the things that’s extremely important is to make sure the diversity of our clinical trials match the population diversity. We can better understand how to design the trial to be effective and efficient and also match the diversity.” </span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Startups are also raising significant amounts of venture capital to expedite the drug discovery and testing process. </span><a href=\"https://benevolent.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BenevolentAI</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a unicorn based in London that has raised $115 million to start over 20 drug programs and create “</span><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/benevolentai-raises-115-million-to-extend-its-leading-global-position-in-the-field-of-ai-enabled-drug-development-680180573.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a bioscience machine brain</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, purpose-built to discover new medicines and cures for disease.” Its first clinical trial this year in Europe and the U.S. will address excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson’s disease. </span></p>\n",
       "<h2>Disease Prevention</h2>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to transform healthcare is to recognize risks and recommend prevention plans before health risks become a major issue. Through wearables and other tracking devices that take into account historical patterns and genetic information, it’s possible to recognize a problem before it gets out of hand.</span></p>\n",

A </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BBC article</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> notes that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180523-how-gender-bias-affects-your-healthcare\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">diagnostic errors</a> cause an estimated 40,000 to 80,000 deaths annually. </span></p>\n",

Testing with a combination of misdiagnosed and correctly diagnosed patients of multiple sclerosis, Iquity predicted with 90 percent accuracy the onset of the disease eight months before it could be detected with traditional tools, like magnetic resonance imaging and spinal tapping. </span></p>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even online searches can help with diagnostic accuracy. </span><a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3159.full\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microsoft researchers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> analyzed 6.4 million users of Bing whose search results suggested that they had pancreatic cancer. Looking back at previous queries for keywords, such as blood clots and weight loss, researchers found that they could use search engine topics to predict a future pancreatic cancer diagnosis. </span></p>\n",
       "<h2>Treatment</h2>\n",
       "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With more data on individual patient characteristics, it is now possible to deliver more precise prescriptions and personalized care.

      " He went on: “That’s one of the benefits of GSK being a large pharmaceutical company because we have hundreds and hundreds and thousands of clinical trials… If you look at the clinical trial data one of the things that’s extremely important is to make sure the diversity of our clinical trials match the population diversity. We can better understand how to design the trial to be effective and efficient and also match the diversity.” \n",
      " Startups are also raising significant amounts of venture capital to expedite the drug discovery and testing process. BenevolentAI is a unicorn based in London that has raised $115 million to start over 20 drug programs and create “a bioscience machine brain, purpose-built to discover new medicines and cures for disease.” Its first clinical trial this year in Europe and the U.S. will address excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson’s disease. \n",

      " One of the most effective uses of data science in healthcare is medical imaging. Computers can learn to interpret MRIs, X-rays, mammographies, and other types of images, identify patterns in the data, and detect tumors, artery stenosis, organ anomalies, and more. \n",
      " Stanford University researchers have also developed data-driven models to diagnose irregular heart rhythms from ECGs more quickly than a cardiologist and distinguish between images showing benign skin marks and malignant lesions.\n",
