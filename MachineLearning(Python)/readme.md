This repository contains various Machine Learning projects I have worked on as a apart of my MSc DataScience Curricum and some projects that are done while learning machine learning. As my couse progressed I have done some projects personally which inspired me to dive deep into data and predict the task at hand by designing modles using ML algorithms.

- Insurance Claim Prediction(classification, Regression)[Insurance](https://github.com/Jhansi-27/Projects-Machinelearning-DeepLearning/tree/main/MachineLearning(Python)/Insurance%20Claim%20Prediction)
- DataWrangling using Pandas library, [DataWrangling.ipynb](https://github.com/Jhansi-27/Projects-Machinelearning-DeepLearning/blob/main/MachineLearning(Python)/DataWrangling.ipynb).
