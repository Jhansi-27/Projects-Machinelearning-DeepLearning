<h2><center>House Price Prediction</center></h2>
<ul>
   <li>The market prices of the houses have a crucial replication on the economy, All the sellers 
and buyers have a great interest in house prices. In this project the prediction of house 
prices taken place by considering all the explanatory variables that play an important role 
in setting a price for house. </li>
   <li>The dataset used in this project consists of data of houses from the city Ames.  </li>
   <li>There are two main aims of the project. </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><b>Create Classification models that can predict the overall condition of the houses based on given features.</b></li>
  <li><b>Create regression models that are ready to accurately estimate the price of a featured house.</b></li>
 </ol>
