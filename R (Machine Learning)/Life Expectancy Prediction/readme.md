Life expectancy is one of the most important factors and helps to anticipate the procurement of 
health care services, pensions, and other facilities. It is also crucial to determine the course of 
treatment and facilitates Advance Care Planning. Physicians tend to overestimate life 
expectancy and miss the window of opportunity to initiate Advance Care Planning [1]. Hence, 
it is much important to determine the correct life expectancy of people. This research tests the 
potential of using machine learning techniques for predicting life expectancy. We approached 
the task of predicting life expectancy as a supervised machine learning task. We trained and 
tested a multiple linear regression model on the dataset provided. We developed the model with 
the help of the backward selection method and evaluated its performance on a test dataset. We 
performed ANOVA testing by bucketing the countries into the continent.
